1. PAPER GOALS
==============

Goals:
- Detect heavy-hitters on the end-host (accounting and classification)
- Push SRH to steer heavy-hitters through different paths (steering)
- Leverage eBPF for all of the above (flexibility)

Non-goals:
- Traffic shaping (simply use fq_codel)
- Low latency

2. KERNEL SUPPORT
=================

2.1. Flow accounting
--------------------

One eBPF program on egress path, program type CGROUP_SKB, attach type CGROUP_INET_EGRESS.
Per-flow accounting in BPF map.

2.2. SRH encapsulation
----------------------

Internal function bpf_push_seg6_encap already implemented. Available through BPF helper
bpf_lwt_in_push_encap. We cannot use it as we are in the output/xmit path rather than
the input path. A helper bpf_lwt_xmit_push_encap exists but has no support for seg6
encap. Adding support for seg6 encap to it should be trivial, O(10) LOC changes.

SRH encapsulation program would be of type LWT_XMIT.

Caveats:
- Agnostic to cgroups
- Must be attached to a route
- Can be sharded per-namespace

Need to reconcile per-cgroup flow accounting with per-namespace policy enforcement.
Option: extend our CGROUP_SKB program to also mark the skb with a unique per-cgroup
socket mark. Encapsulation program will fetch SRH from eBPF map with key (5-tuple, mark).

2.3. Qdisc
----------

Traffic shaping is a non-goal but we want to have at least fairness between flows.
We can simply use fq_codel for that.

3. USERSPACE CONTROLLER
=======================

A userspace controller would periodically iterate over the flow accounting table (eBPF map),
detect heavy hitters, and accordingly update the encapsulation eBPF map with appropriate SRHs.

4. PERFORMANCES IMPLICATIONS
============================

The following items can impact the performances:
- Encapsulation (memcpy).
- For GSO skbs, gso_segs will be invalidated and recomputed in device layer. This adds a division in the fast path.

The following design choices can avoid performance losses:
- If we use LWT_XMIT instead of LWT_OUT, we do not need to do an additional route lookup. The encapsulated packet
  will be delivered to the original next-hop selected based on the inner header DA. This is perfectly fine on an
  end-host scenario.
